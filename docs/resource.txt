Hi there,

I hope you're doing well! I'm reaching out to see if you're open to sharing new resources with your community to your page, https://jinghuazhao.github.io/resource.html?

My name is Enmanuel and I work with Drugwatch - a health site, featured in publications such as The New York Times and Healthline.

Ozempic, a brand-name semaglutide drug, is an injectable medication that treats Type 2 diabetes. The drug isn't FDA-approved to treat obesity, but some doctors have been prescribing it for off-label uses such as weight loss in people without Type 2 diabetes.

In an effort to share more information about the newly popular drug, we recently published two guides about Ozempic. They cover its use, side effects, interactions, and more. Please take a look:

drugwatch.com/drugs/ozempic/
drugwatch.com/drugs/ozempic/side-effects/

I thought this information would be valuable to share with your community! Feel free to let me know your thoughts or questions.

I appreciate your time and hope to hear from you soon!

Kind regards,
Enmanuel Batista Shedrack

    Good day,

    I hope this email finds you well.

    I am writing you to see if you are still actively updating your page, https://jinghuazhao.github.io/resource.html?

    My name is Nomhle, and I work with SouthJerseyRecovery.com, a free web resource that provides information about addiction, eating disorders, and mental health issues.

    Studies have found that when someone with a depressive disorder abuses alcohol, both disorders are impacted and often become more severe. In the same vein, major depressive disorder is the most common co-occurring mental health condition among those with alcohol use disorder (AUD).

    To spread awareness to the public, we recently published a guide covering depression and addiction, where we expand on the connection between depression and drug addiction, treatment options, FAQs, and more.

    Please take a look:
    https://www.southjerseyrecovery.com/treatment-programs/dual-diagnosis/depression/

    To better serve your community, would you consider adding this resource to your page?

    I look forward to hearing back from you. Have a great rest of your day.

I hope your week has been great thus far!

I was browsing your website when I came across your resource page with some details on alcohol detox, cocaine detox, and heroin detox.

I was curious if you might have space for more information. Please take a look at https://pathtorecoverydetox.com

This website provides information on a foundation for rehabilitation and treatment by improving the physical, spiritual and
emotional well-being of those who struggle with chemical dependency.

Links and/or information regarding Path to Recovery would be a wonderful addition to your mental health section!

Let me know if there is any more information, copy, or creatives I can send to you to help add this link to your page.

Thank you for your consideration. Thanks, Dominique

Hello Jing,

I hope all is well. We've all heard the common phrase: "Drink in
moderation." it turns out that this phrase may be more important than we
thought. Recent studies have shown that no level of alcohol consumption
is safe for our health and can cause cancer. Alcohol is a level-one
carcinogen, right up with tobacco and asbestos, which means it is a
substance that causes cancer.

That's why we recently updated our guide to the potential effects of
alcohol, focusing on the link between alcohol and cancer. Here is our
guide:https://alcoholrehabhelp.org/addiction/effects/cancer/
<https://alcoholrehabhelp.org/addiction/effects/cancer/>.

We include the following:

  *
    An overview of the link between alcohol and cancer.
  *
    The types of cancer that can be caused by alcohol consumption.
  *
    How drinking alcohol affects the body.


I believe your readers would benefit from our article. Would you help us
help your readers by adding a link to our guide on your site?

You can add it here:https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html
<https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html>.

I think your readers would benefit from our resource, and I would be
happy to answer any questions you have about it.

I noticed your site has a lot of great resources for substance abuse,
drug and alcohol.

I have an informative link (https://www.northernillinoisrecovery.com/resources/
<https://www.northernillinoisrecovery.com/resources/>)  for your website https://jinghuazhao.github.io/ <https://jinghuazhao.github.io/>

Could you please review and update it on your resource page?

This will help your site visitors and help to engage the traffic :) 

If you need any more information from me, please just let me know.

Hey there,

Hope you're having a good time.

I was looking through your site and saw some information about addiction at jinghuazhao.github.io. I was wondering if you might have room for additional addiction, alcohol, and cancer materials. In honour of National Substance Abuse Prevention Month in October, please see https://magnoliacitydetox.com/programs/.

The above resource from Magnolia City Detox could make a great addition to the "Resource/Helpful links" column.
 
My name is Emma Tressler, a Community Relations Specialist at Magnolia City Detox. Including the link above, I was hoping to share a few more pages and discuss the possibility of highlighting their information.
 
It was a pleasure visiting your website, and I appreciate your time in advance. Should I not hear back, do you mind me reaching out next week? If not, please let me know, and I'll refrain from sending any further emails.
 
Have a nice day.

Regards,
