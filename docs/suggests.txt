Hello Jing,

I hope all is well. We've all heard the common phrase: "Drink in
moderation." it turns out that this phrase may be more important than we
thought. Recent studies have shown that no level of alcohol consumption
is safe for our health and can cause cancer. Alcohol is a level-one
carcinogen, right up with tobacco and asbestos, which means it is a
substance that causes cancer.

That's why we recently updated our guide to the potential effects of
alcohol, focusing on the link between alcohol and cancer. Here is our
guide:https://alcoholrehabhelp.org/addiction/effects/cancer/
<https://alcoholrehabhelp.org/addiction/effects/cancer/>.

We include the following:

  *
    An overview of the link between alcohol and cancer.
  *
    The types of cancer that can be caused by alcohol consumption.
  *
    How drinking alcohol affects the body.


I believe your readers would benefit from our article. Would you help us
help your readers by adding a link to our guide on your site?

You can add it here:https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html
<https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html>.

I think your readers would benefit from our resource, and I would be
happy to answer any questions you have about it.

I noticed your site has a lot of great resources for substance abuse,
drug and alcohol.

I have an informative link (https://www.northernillinoisrecovery.com/resources/
<https://www.northernillinoisrecovery.com/resources/>)  for your website https://jinghuazhao.github.io/ <https://jinghuazhao.github.io/>

Could you please review and update it on your resource page?

This will help your site visitors and help to engage the traffic :) 

If you need any more information from me, please just let me know.

Hey there,

Hope you're having a good time.

I was looking through your site and saw some information about addiction at jinghuazhao.github.io. I was wondering if you might have room for additional addiction, alcohol, and cancer materials. In honour of National Substance Abuse Prevention Month in October, please see https://magnoliacitydetox.com/programs/.

The above resource from Magnolia City Detox could make a great addition to the "Resource/Helpful links" column.
 
My name is Emma Tressler, a Community Relations Specialist at Magnolia City Detox. Including the link above, I was hoping to share a few more pages and discuss the possibility of highlighting their information.
 
It was a pleasure visiting your website, and I appreciate your time in advance. Should I not hear back, do you mind me reaching out next week? If not, please let me know, and I'll refrain from sending any further emails.
 
Have a nice day.

Regards,
