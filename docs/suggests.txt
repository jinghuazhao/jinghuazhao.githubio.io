Subject: Suggestions for Resource Link
 

Hey there,

Hope you're having a good time.

I was looking through your site and saw some information about addiction at jinghuazhao.github.io. I was wondering if you might have room for additional addiction, alcohol, and cancer materials. In honour of National Substance Abuse Prevention Month in October, please see https://magnoliacitydetox.com/programs/.

The above resource from Magnolia City Detox could make a great addition to the "Resource/Helpful links" column.
 
My name is Emma Tressler, a Community Relations Specialist at Magnolia City Detox. Including the link above, I was hoping to share a few more pages and discuss the possibility of highlighting their information.
 
It was a pleasure visiting your website, and I appreciate your time in advance. Should I not hear back, do you mind me reaching out next week? If not, please let me know, and I'll refrain from sending any further emails.
 
Have a nice day.

Regards,

--
