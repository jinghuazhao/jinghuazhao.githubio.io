See [here](https://jinghuazhao.github.io/Computational-Statistics/LANGUAGES/#shinyapps) for information on how these were set up.

Given the uncertainty with the Shiny server availability, it is an optional choice to run these locally within RStudio by the following steps:

1. Download the appropriate repository,
2. Enter the directory containing the Shiny app (i.e., ui.R and server.R); for R/gap this is `inst/shinygap` from the source or `shinygap` in the installed package.
3. Start RStudio (through the rstudio command), and issue `library(shiny);runApp()`

Note `shinygap` is self-contained through `R/global.R` whereas `shinySurvival` requires `survminer` be installed.
