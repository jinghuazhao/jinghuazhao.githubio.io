I have converted some functionality of my programs, implemented new
functions or maintained packages by colleagues into R. as reported in
[gap: Genetic Analysis Package](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v023i08). Most are on
the [Rockefeller list of genetic software](https://github.com/gaow/genetic-analysis-software). The
examples provided for [SAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_System),
[Stata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata) and
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) can be considered as extension to those in [Genetic
Dissection of Complex Traits *In Silico*: Approaches, Problems and
Solutions](paper/cbio06.pdf). A summary of my recent work on mixed
models is described in [Mixed Modeling with Whole Genome
Data](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jps/2012/485174/) and [Bayesian
Linear Mixed Models with Polygenic Effects](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v085i06).

-   [C programs](c-progs.md)
-   [R packages](r-progs.md) (notably [Genetic Analysis Package](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v23/i08) and [Mixed-effects Cox models of alcohol dependence in extended families](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2156-6-S1-S127))
-   [SAS programs](sas-progs.md)
-   [Stata programs](stata-progs.md)
-   [Miscellaneous programs](misc-progs.md)

I also made a [University of London](http://www.lon.ac.uk/)
[LaTeX](http://www.ctan.org/) [thesis class](software/ulthesis.zip),
together with [Endnote](http://www.endnote.com/) [genetic reference library](iop/jinghua/refs/genetics.enl)
and keep some notes on [MFC programming](iop/jinghua/winprog/winprog.html) and [some programs for genetic data analysis](software/softlink.html)
