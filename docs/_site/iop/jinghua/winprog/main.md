title: Introduction to MFC Programming with Visual C++ Version 6.x by Marshall Brain
---

## Series Overview

The goal of this series is to help you to gain an understanding of the
fundamental concepts that make MFC programs work under Visual C++. Many
people jump into Visual C++, start up the AppWizard, have it generate a
new program framework, and then hit a wall. That wall arises because it
is hard to understand the MFC code generated by the AppWizard. This same
wall affects people who try to work through the \"Scribble\" tutorial
that comes with Visual C++. Without a fundamental understanding of MFC
code structure, the tutorials simply make no sense.

This series starts at the very beginning, and shows you the simple,
fundamental concepts that drive any MFC program. Once you have finished
this series you will find that MFC and the App Wizard output make a lot
more sense.
